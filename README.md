This [lfctrio notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/terrydolan/lfctrio/blob/master/lfctrio.ipynb) analyses Liverpool Football Club's goalscoring data from 1892-1893 to 2014-2015. In particular Liverpool's top scoring trio is identified and compared to Barcelona's best from 2014-2015. 

The analysis uses IPython Notebook, python, pandas and matplotlib to investigate the data from lfchistory.net. The  graphs are generated automatically from the munged data to help describe LFC's performance.
